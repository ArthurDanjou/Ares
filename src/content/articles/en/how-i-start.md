## Presentation
Many ask me how I started development, what training did I take and why did I start?
Here is the article allowing you to discover everything.

### Summary
- How it all began ?
- And the web in all this?
- What training did I follow?
- What am I capable of achieving today?
- How do I see my future in this area?
- Conclusion

## 1. How did it all start?
Being a video game player and very curious, I inquired about how a video game worked.
At that time I was playing Minecraft, so I discovered the existence of development and my first programming language: **Java**.
So I wanted to add my personal touch and my creativity to the community. Therefore, I learned to use this language, the syntax and all that goes with it.
So I installed my first development environment and started with very small projects.

## 2. And the web in all this?
It was much later that I became aware of the vastness of the web domain. As I got really interested in this new field,
So I learned new programming languages: **JavaScript**, **Html** and **Css**.
These languages were much easier to learn because I had a good foundation in programming. I trained as much in `Front` development as in` Back` development.
The `Front` results in the interface of the application visible by a user and the` Back` by the part invisible and inaccessible by a user.

## 3. What training did I take?
When I started, I took a course on [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com) to learn Java syntax.
In addition, I bought myself a big book, very big 400-page book called `Programming in Java`. I acquired new functionalities such as the principles of object programming for example.
Today, I mostly learn on my own using the Internet and development discord servers.
Recently, I have been taking training on [Udemy](https://udemy.com) in particular to learn **Go** and **Docker**.
Finally, I also use [Youtube](https://youtube.com) to follow more or less technical tutorials.

## 4. What am I able to achieve today
Currently, I am able to do entire web applications, both the `Back` and the `Front`. As mobile and office applications are based on the same technologies,
I also know how to develop applications of this type. To see all my skills mastered, please visit my [About](/about) page, in the _Technical Skills_ section.

## 5. How do I see my future in this field?
I am currently asking myself a lot of questions about my future in development and my professional future. So I attend a lot of computer conferences and do a lot of research.
Lately, I learned about an area that I knew only vaguely. It was a very great interest that immediately developed for this area because it meets all my expectations, 
and I think I will thrive in this area a lot!

## 6. Conclusion
Now you know everything about my beginning and my journey. I hope I have answered all of your questions and that you know how you can start your own journey!
I am available for all your additional questions!
